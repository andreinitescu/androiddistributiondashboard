# Android Distribution Dashboard

Some time ago, Google removed the pie chart showing the distribution of the Android releases from their [Distribution dashboard page](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards):

> 
> #### <b>Platform versions</b>
> 
> You can find platform version information in Android Studio's Create New Project wizard.


I made a web tool which gets and displays the Android distribution data from the same source as in Android Studio:
